        A terms and conditions agreement outlines the rules around user data and 
        provides information about the actions the website will execute. The terms
        and conditions content is a legal contract between website and its users. 
        In the event of a violation of contract conditions, adjudicators will look
        at it to determine whether each petitioner behaved within their rights.
